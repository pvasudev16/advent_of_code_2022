# Advent of Code 2022
These are my solutions to the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenge.
I've written my solutions in C++. To compile the files, I use `clang++`:
```bash
$ clang++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 ./advent_of_code_day_X.cpp -o ./advent_of_code_day_X
```

For Day 10 Part 2, this is the message. Kinda neat!
